    "### Checklist for submission\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important to make sure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",
    "3. All outputs are present (don't delete any of the outputs);\n",
    "4. Fill in all the places that say `# YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. Never copy/paste any notebook cells. Inserting new cells is allowed, but it should not be necessary.\n",
    "6. The notebook contains some hidden metadata which is important during our grading process. **Make sure not to corrupt any of this metadata!** The metadata may for example be corrupted if you copy/paste any notebook cells, or if you perform an unsuccessful git merge / git pull. It may also be pruned completely if using Google Colab, so watch out for this. Searching for \"nbgrader\" when opening the notebook in a text editor should take you to the important metadata entries.\n",
    "7. Although we will try our very best to avoid this, it may happen that bugs are found after an assignment is released, and that we will push an updated version of the assignment to GitHub. If this happens, it is important that you update to the new version, while making sure the notebook metadata is properly updated as well. The safest way to make sure nothing gets messed up is to start from scratch on a clean updated version of the notebook, copy/pasting your code from the cells of the previous version into the cells of the new version.\n",
    "8. If you need to have multiple parallel versions of this notebook, make sure not to move them to another directory.\n",
    "9. Although not forced to work exclusively in the course `conda` environment, you need to make sure that the notebook will run in that environment, i.e. that you have not added any additional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to a request for resubmission if the errors are serious enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to perform the following steps before submission to ensure that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use a cloud GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "In this home assignment, you'll apply roughly the same principles we used when doing logistic regression on the Iris dataset in Computer Lab 1, but on a different and very interesting dataset. We'll use the [Predict'em All dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall). To download the dataset you will need a Kaggle account. This dataset consists of roughly 293,000 [pokemon](http://www.pokemongo.com/) sightings (historical appearances of Pokemon in the Pokemon Go game), with geographical coordinates, time, weather, population density, distance to pokestops/gyms etc. as features. A comprehensive list of all the features is available at [the dataset's homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall).\n",

    "The context is simple: you are a Pokemon hunter, and there are only three Pokemon left for you to complete your collection. You'll do anything to capture them, including changing where you'll spend your next holidays! You know that some Pokemon only spawn in certain places of the world. Since you like machine learning so much, you figure it would be a great idea to train a classifier that, based on a location's longitude and latitude, can tell us which Pokemon is more likely to appear there.\n",

    "6. Exploration\n",

    "Don't restrict yourself only to what was taught so far. Some of the tasks might require you to search for new information. However, **be sure that you do the assignment using PyTorch** since we will be using it through the following assignments as well. [The Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/), [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and Google are your friends!\n",
